# Make Assignment - Modify Strings

A user can make mistakes or enter strings you weren't expecting into the console. Use the string modifications you learned to "clean" the data that is inputted in the console. You want each user to have a first and last name. The first letter in each should be capitalized. There should be no spaces before or after the name.

## Clean the name data directions.
1. Ask for the user to input their name and assign it to a variable.
2. Print the username as entered and then print the corrected username. 
3. Change the user input to capitalize only the first letter of their first and last name.
4. Change the user input to remove extra spaces before or behind their name.
5. Change the user input to have one space only between last and first name.
6. Change the user input to remove titles such as Mr. or Mrs.
7. Change the user input to remove middle names if they exist.
