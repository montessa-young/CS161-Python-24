# Make Assignment - Check Book Program

## Background Info 
Write a Python program to balance a checkbook. The main function needs to get the initial balance, the amounts of deposits, and the amounts of transactions. Allow the user to process as many transactions as desired; use separate functions to handle deposits and checks.

## Make it
1. Create functions to handle deposits and checks
2. Ask the user for the initial balance.
3. Ask the user for each transaction to be made (going to need an if loop here)
4. If the balance is 0 quit asking for transactions (going to need a while loop here)
5. Calculate and print the current balance after each transaction entry.
