## Your Task

Write a program that outputs a joke on multiple lines

#### Help! My Code Doesn't Work!

Make sure that you check for the following things:

- `print` does not have any capital letters
- The string text is surrounded with speech marks `" "`
- The string (including speech marks) is surrounded by brackets `( )`.
- Each print statement will output a new line.
