# Make Assignment - Sports Roster Program
Create a dictionary to hold the roster of a sports team.
The keys are the player names and the values are their positions.
Create a menu that allows the user to print roster, add a player, delete a player or change the players position.


The menu should repeat until the user chooses to exit.
The menu should include a prompt for the user to choose an option.
The options should be:
  * Print Roster
  * Add Player
  * Change Position
  * Delete Player


The dictionary should be printed after each action to confirm that the action worked.
