# Instructions  

 ## Code along with Instructor
 Hands on keyboard discovery of variables
 Type following code into IDE and run to show output

## Code: 
# elif keeps you from having to write separate if statements
# start with if
# then any number of elif
# end with else (works as catch all)
x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
y = "start"
if x < 5:
  print("The number is less than 5")
  y = "first if"
elif x < 10:
  print("The number is less than 10")
  y = "first elif"
elif x < 20:
  print("The number is less than 20")
  y = "second elif"
elif x < 30:
  print("The number is less than 30")
  y = "third elif"
elif x < 40:
  print("The number is less than 40")
  y = "fourth elif"
else:
  print("The number is out of range")
  y = "else"

print(y)

# Expected Output:
Enter a number: 10
The number is less than 20
second elif
