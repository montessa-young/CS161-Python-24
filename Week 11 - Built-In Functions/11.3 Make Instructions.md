# Make Assignment - Grade Book Program

A common place where you need to manipulate data is in a grade book.
The built-in functions can help with this. You'll also need your list skills.

## Grade Book

1. Create a list of at least 10 items that represents percentage scores in a grade book. [my_list = [95,97,86,45...]]
2. Print the average of the scores. [Hint: Sum of items / number of items would get you an average]
3. Print the lowest score. Ask user if they want to remove the lowest score. If they do, remove from list. Print the new average. 
4. Round the new average to the nearest whole number and print the rounded average.
5. Create a random new test score and add to the list.
6. Print the average with the new random test score added.
