# Instructions  
Ask the user to input the amount of cups of an ingredient. Output metric mL, US fluid oz,  tablespoons, pints, and quarts. 

## Volume Measurement Calculator

Recipes from the US often use volume measures instead of weight measures, so the units like cups or fluid ounces appear. If you want to know how to convert cups to mL, then you are in the right place.

For this calculator you can take the average values of product density, so your ingredient may differ slightly. Also, it matters how tightly you pack the container, so the result obtained is a rough approximation.

Cups to milliliters: V [ml] = V [cups] × 236.588.
Cups to tablespoons: V [tbsp] = V [cups] × 16.
1 cup = 8 fl. oz. in US system
1 cup = 236.59 mL in Metric equivalent
1 pint = 2 cups
1 quart = 4 cups
