# Instructions  
Ask the user to input the initial velocity, height, and angle of the projectile. Ouput the maximum height and distance the projectile travels.

 
## Projectile Motion Calculator
Imagine an archer sending an arrow in the air. It starts moving up and forward, at some inclination to the ground. The further it flies, the slower its ascent is – and finally, it starts descending, moving now downwards and forwards and finally hitting the ground again. If you could trace its path, it would be a curve called a trajectory in the shape of a parabola. Any object moving in such a way is in projectile motion.

Only one force acts on a projectile – the gravity force. Air resistance is always omitted. If you drew a free body diagram of such an object, you would only have to draw one downward vector and denote it “gravity”. If there were any other forces acting on the body, then – by projectile motion definition – it wouldn't be a projectile.
