Business Loan  
## Loan Payment Calculator

A business loan is a sum of money that a financial institution lends to a company. The business borrowing the loan is expected to repay the amount and the agreed-upon interest over a specified period.

Business loans are a lifeline for many businesses, helping companies to cover costs such as start-up expenses, expansion costs, equipment purchases, and other operational costs. These loans come in different forms, such as term loans, credit lines, equipment financing, and invoice financing, each designed to suit various business needs.

1. Interest rate: This is the annual interest rate, a vital factor when considering an installment loan.
2. Loan amount: This is the principal or the loan amount, from which some lenders may deduct fees.
3. Compounding frequency: The frequency at which interest is computed. This is usually monthly.
4. Loan term: The duration for loan repayment, including all associated costs.
5. Payment frequency: The regular intervals for loan repayments.
6. Monthly payment: The amount due per period until the loan is fully repaid.

Monthly payment = (loan amount) × (interest rate / 12) / (1 - (1 + (interest rate / 12)) ^ (- loan term)).

The interest rate is given for a period of one year.

## Example Calculation
Use the formula to compute the monthly payments:
 Interest rate is 4% per year
 Amount borrowed is $12,200
 Loan term is 3 years
 
($12,200) × (4% / 12) / (1 - (1 + (4% / 12)) ^ (-36)) = $360.19

The answer is $360.19. It is your monthly payment in the loan from our example.
