## Create a username and password checker.

2. Ask for the user to input their password and assign it to a variable. 
3. Check the username for the criteria above. If it doesn't meet the criteria print an error message that says what is wrong with the username.
4. Check the password for the criteria above. If it doesn't meet the criteria print an error message that says what is wrong with the password.
5. Print a message like "Hi {username}, Your password is: {password} and is confirmed" when both the username and password are correct.
