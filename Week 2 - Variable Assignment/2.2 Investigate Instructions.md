# Task - Investigate

Use comments to answer the investigate questions on the example code.

## What is a variable?
A variable is a placeholder for information you want Python to recall later in the coding process when you need to complete an action. 
Technically, the variable acts as an address for where the data is stored in memory.
A Python variable may be assigned a value of one type and then later re-assigned a value of a different type.
For example, x = "apples" can later be x = 5.
