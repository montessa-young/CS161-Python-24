# Task - Predict and Run
This task contains three code examples.

Look at each example , study it carefully. Write a prediction of what it will do when it runs. Your prediction should be added to the code as comments. You should use the key terms variable, assign and concatenate in your prediction.

## What is assignment?
A Python variable is a named bit of computer memory, keeping track of a value as the code runs.
A variable is created with an "assignment" equal sign = , with the variable's name on the left and the value it should store on the right: x = 42.

## What is concatenation?
String concatenation means adding strings together.
Use the + character to add a variable to another variable.

## Help! My Code Doesn't Work!
Make sure that you check for the following things:

* You have typed the variable name exactly the same (including caps), every time
* There is a variable on the left of each assignment
* You have used a single = for assignment
* You have used the + symbol to concatenate (join).
* The string text is surrounded by speech marks.
* The + and variable identifiers are not surrounded by speech marks
